# Stabelcoin Design

1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged -> $ or KES
   1. Chainlink Price feed
   2. Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> $ or KES
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
   1. People can only mint stablecoins with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
   1. wETH
   2. wBTC
